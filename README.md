- 👋 Hello, I’m @annefetrow, Anne C. Fetrow (she/her) 
- 👀 I’m interested in using stable single and clumped isotope geochemistry and terrestrial carbonate sedimentology to study paleoclimate, paleoenvironments, paleoaltimetry.
- 🌱 I'm currently working on finishing my disseratation! And also on improving my general R coding, ggplot-ing, and stable isotope and carbonate equilibria modeling skills. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for postdoctoral positions and/or tenure-track faculty positions in geology, geochemistry, and/or paleoclimatology. 
- 📫 How to reach me: anne.fetrow@colorado.edu or my *website* (coming soon!)
