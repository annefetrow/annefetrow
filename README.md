I am a NSF postdoctoral scholar at University of Michigan in the Earth and Environmental Sciences department.
I study terrestrial climates and terrestrial environments using stable isotope geochemistry, carbonate sedimentology, and environmental geochemistry.

Currently, I am working on a project in which I am using triple oxygen and clumped isotopes to better quantify evaporation from Mono Lake, CA. A major goal of this research is to use geochemical data and hydrologic modeling to assist with water management and conservation strategies in the face of a rapidly changing climate. As well, this project aims to more directly connect our understanding of the modern hydrologic system to changes in the regional hydroclimate in the recent geologic past. Anne’s broader research interests focus on how different terrestrial sedimentary archives and geochemical proxies encode the signals of climatic and environmental change in the geologic past.
